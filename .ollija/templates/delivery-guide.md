### Failure handling

- Never promote a staging candidate whose automated checks failed.
- Implementation failures return to the ${code_failure_route} for diagnosis, correction, recommit, and restaging.
- SSH, shell, environment, or multi-machine failures use the ${infra_failure_route} first.
- The change ledger is advisory; do not validate or enforce it.
- Do not run an endless retry loop or start a persistent Ollija process.
